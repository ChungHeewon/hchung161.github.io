          <p>The getBetterPlayer() used an algorithm to determine who would have a higher chance of winning the NBA league Most Valuable Player(MVP) this season. The user is able to enter in information about the two players that they think have a good chance and the computer who decide who has a higher chance. This is done through the database of statistics that was created for the getPlayerInfo() method. The output will be whoever the computer thinks has a higher chance of winning the MVP and why.</p>
          <p>This method uses the equals method to determine what players the users want to compare. Both playersâ€™ statistics are put through a model to determine which one had a better chance. This model could be expanded in the future by including more inputs and training it with more data.</p>
