          <p>The getPlayerInfo method was one of the core methods that Chadbot was built upon. Its main features are returning player-specific data based on what the use types into the console. The user converses with the chatbot in order for the chatbot to find out which statistics the user wants for which player. The statistics are displayed to the user and the whole process is repeated until the user quits out.</p>
          <p>As for the edge cases, the use is prompted to type in another playerâ€™s name when the player they typed is not in the database. The contains method was used extensively to mimic natural language processing. In this case, most of the keywords that users could think of qualifies as keywords that the computer used to detect what specifically the user wants. This model was tested on the developers and other strangers for potential positive and negative keywords that could be added to the database.</p>
